# Lab 3–Operational Amplifiers

[**Homepage**](./index.html)

## Task 1 - Loading effect on analogue output of SIG_GEN

The scope was used to verify that the SIG_GEN output was roughly correct. Frequency was measured to be 10.07 kHz, V pk-pk was measured to be 1.66 V.

When the 220 ohm resistor was added, V pp went down to 1.28 V

The peak to peak voltage is reduced as there is a fixed output voltage and the resistor obeys Ohm’s law, so the voltage is divided.

## Task 2 - Unity Gain Amplifier

The chip and decoupling capacitor were installed on the breadboard as shown in the photo.

The unity gain non-inverting buffer was set up as shown below. When the 220 Ohm resistor was tested, the peak-to-peak voltage was no longer reduced by the resistor.

==Explain why==

## Task 3 - Amplification X2 Failure

==show that explected gain is x2==

The circuit was assembled as per the instructions. Vmax was measured to be 0.75V, Vmin was measured to be -1.11V.

The sine waves were clipped (saturated) as expected.

## Task 4 - AC couple of source signal and X2 amplification success

I was missing one $1\mu F$ capacitor so was unable to complete task 4.

## Task 5 -
