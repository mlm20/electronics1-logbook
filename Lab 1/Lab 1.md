# Lab 1 - Signals and Scope

## Task 1 - Learning to control the signal generator

By following the instructions, I tried out using the different signal settings. Initially this did not work - I was unable to switch from the sine wave signal option, subsequently I realised that I had a wire wrong which I fixed, allowing me to test out the options.

## Task 2 - Setting up the oscilloscope

The oscilloscope was set up as per the instructions

## Task 3 - Understanding the DSO display

By using the provided documents to learn how to extract information from the oscilloscope display, I determined that the waveform had the following characteristics:

A square wave with a period of 1 ms, an amplitude of 0.3V, and therefore a frequency of 1 kHz.

## Task 4 - Controlling the DSO with the buttons and the rotary switch

As the ADJ knob is turned after pressing the `V/DIV` button twice the waveform is moved up and down the y (voltage) axis, maintaining the shape. This is useful as it allows the user to align the bottom of the waveform with the grid and thus make more accurate measurements from it.

The `SEC/DIV` button exercise was completed. When the timescale is slower than 20ms per division the wave is unable to be properly triggered and displayed causing strange  visual effects.

After pressing the `SEC/DIV` button a second time, the waveform is able to be adjusted along the x (time) axis, allowing it to be aligned with the grid for accurate measurements.

When it is switched to AC, the waveform drifts down the y (voltage) axis to its (neutral) midpoint. This is useful as it tells us the vertical midpoint of the waveform.

## Task 5 - Triggering on an oscillation
