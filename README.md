# Logbook for Electronics 1 - Max Matthews

This is my logbook for the laboratory activities for the DE1 Electronics 1 module. The notes for each lab activity are stored in the `markdown` folder.

---

The `.md`  files are made to be read using [Typora](https://typora.io/) (with the [Gitbook](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Gitbook/) theme), a markdown editor with support for additional features e.g. LaTeX.
