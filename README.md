# Testing



This is a test

---

Here is some test $\LaTeX$
$$
f(x)=\exp(x)=e^x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infin}\frac{x^n}{n!}
$$

---

Here is a code block

```python
x = ['Hello World', 'A message']
print(f'{x[0]} this is {x[-1]}')
```

And here is a mermaid chart using `mermaid`:

```mermaid
pie
"red: 0.3
blue: 0.6
yellow: 0.1
```
